# Flask Web Application with Flask-SocketIO

This Flask web application leverages Flask-SocketIO for real-time interaction. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

## Imports and Setup

- Import necessary libraries: `Flask`, `render_template`, `session`, `request` for web server functionalities, and `SocketIO`, `emit` for real-time communication.
- Import custom classes: `SSHManager`, `PasswordManager`, and `ChatManager` for managing SSH connections, password handling, and chat interactions, respectively.
- Initialize the app with a random secret key and set up SocketIO.

## Creating Manager Instances

- Create instances of `SSHManager`, `PasswordManager`, and `ChatManager` to manage specific functionalities in the app.

## Routes

- Define a route (`/`) that renders an HTML template, displaying the levels defined in `BANDIT_LEVELS`.

## SocketIO Events

- `connect_ssh`: Handles the SSH connection. It checks if both username and password are provided, attempts to connect via `ssh_manager.connect()`, and emits success/error messages.
- `ssh_command`: Processes commands sent by the client. It executes the command using `ssh_manager.execute_command()` and checks output for any passwords using `password_manager.check_output_for_password()`. If a password is found, it emits a congratulatory message and updates progress.
- `get_progress`: Emits the user's progress using `password_manager.get_progress()`.
- `get_saved_password`: Retrieves saved passwords for specific levels and emits it back to the client.
- `disconnect`: Cleans up by disconnecting the SSH session for the user.
- `chat_message`: Handles chat messages. It uses `ChatManager` to generate a response based on the user's input and current level, sending the response back to the client.

## Running the App

- Run the application with debugging enabled, and ensure to close any active SSH connections if the app shuts down.

Overall, the code provides users with an interactive platform to connect through SSH, manage passwords, and chat while progressing through defined levels. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific section!
